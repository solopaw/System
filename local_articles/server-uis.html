<h1>Server UIs</h1>
<h6>With a behavior pack?</h6>
<p>
	Do you know the fancy Java Minecraft Server UIs? Well, we can do the exact same thing just with a behavior pack. You can optimize the system with a few commands.
	The technique is based on turning the entity into an item hopper, spawning the items the inventory should have with a BP and the <em>minecraft:equipment</em> component.
	You can then chain the component groups to create an immersive new UI.

<h6>Where's your generator?</h6>
<p>
	This would work perfectly if Minecraft Bedrock would update inventories correctly after they've been changed. In fact, I even have the generator completely ready for a release
	but I am holding it back because of this issue. With this technique, you could add NPC dialogs and you also get a deep behavior integration which a "simple" UI edit cannot offer.
